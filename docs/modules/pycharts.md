#Pycharts


PyCharts is a Python library that allows you to create various types of charts and graphs using Python code. With PyCharts, you can create line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and more. PyCharts is built on top of the popular Matplotlib library, which provides a wide range of options for customizing the appearance of your charts.

One of the benefits of using PyCharts is that you can easily integrate it with other Python libraries and frameworks. For example, you can use PyCharts to create charts for web applications built using Flask or Django. PyCharts is also designed to be user-friendly, with a simple syntax and intuitive API that makes it easy to get started.

To use PyCharts, you first need to install the library using pip. Once you have PyCharts installed, you can import the library and start creating charts in your Python code. You can customize various aspects of your charts, such as the axis labels, title, legend, colors, and more.

PyCharts is a powerful and flexible tool for creating charts and graphs in Python, whether you're a data scientist or a web developer. With its wide range of features and ease of use, PyCharts is a popular choice for visualizing data in Python.


## Basic Bar Chart using pycharts:
Here we create a simple bar chart that displays the sales of three types of fruit. The chart object is first created, and then data is added to it using the add_data method. The chart title, axis labels, and dimensions are all set using various properties of the chart object, and then the bar chart is created using the create_bar method.


``` python
from pychart import Chart

# Create a chart object
chart = Chart()

# Add data to the chart
data = {'Apples': 5, 'Bananas': 8, 'Oranges': 3}
chart.add_data(data)

# Set the chart title
chart.title = 'Fruit Sales'

# Set the labels for the x and y axes
chart.x_labels = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges']
chart.y_labels = ['0', '2', '4', '6', '8', '10']

# Set the axis labels
chart.x_axis_label = 'Fruit'
chart.y_axis_label = 'Sales'

# Set the chart dimensions
chart.width = 500
chart.height = 400

# Create a bar chart
chart.create_bar()

```

  To begin, we create a Chart object using the Chart() function. This initializes an empty chart that we can add data to.

  Next, we define a dictionary data that contains the sales data for each fruit. The keys of the dictionary represent the fruit names, and the values represent the sales figures. For example, 'Apples': 5 means that 5 apples were sold.

  We then add this data to the chart object using the add_data() method. This method takes in the dictionary of data that we just defined.

  We set the title of the chart using the title property of the chart object. This is just a string that will appear at the top of the chart.

  Next, we set the labels for the x and y axes of the chart using the x_labels and y_labels properties. These are lists of strings that represent the labels for each tick on the axis. For example, ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges'] is a list of the fruit names that will be displayed along the x-axis of the chart.

  We also set the axis labels using the x_axis_label and y_axis_label properties. These are just strings that will be displayed next to the x and y axes of the chart.

  Finally, we set the dimensions of the chart using the width and height properties. These are just integers that represent the pixel width and height of the chart.

  To actually create the bar chart, we call the create_bar() method of the chart object. This generates the chart image based on the data and settings that we've defined.

  Overall, this code example demonstrates how to use pychart to create a simple bar chart with custom data, labels, and dimensions. With this basic understanding, you can build on this example to create more complex charts with multiple data sets, custom colors, and other features offered by the library.


## Basic Scatter Plot using pycharts:
This code will create a scatter plot with the data points (1, 10), (2, 8), (3, 6), (4, 4), and (5, 2), and display it with the specified title and axis labels. You can modify the x_data and y_data lists to use your own data points.


``` python
import pycharts

# Create data
x_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y_data = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]

# Create scatter plot
scatter = pycharts.Scatter(x=x_data, y=y_data)

# Customize plot
scatter.title = "Example Scatter Plot"
scatter.x_label = "X Axis Label"
scatter.y_label = "Y Axis Label"

# Show plot
scatter.show()

```

First, we import the Pycharts library using the following code:
Next, we create the data for the scatter plot using two lists: x_data and y_data. These lists contain the x and y coordinates of each data point.
After that, we create a Scatter object and pass in the x_data and y_data lists as arguments.
We can customize the plot by setting the title and labels for the x and y axes using the following code:
Finally, we can display the scatter plot using the show() method.
This will open up a window with the scatter plot displaying the data points with the specified title and axis labels.\
You can modify the x_data and y_data lists to use your own data points and customize the plot further by changing the color, marker size, and other parameters of the Scatter object.
